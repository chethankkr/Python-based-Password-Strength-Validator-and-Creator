# Python-based-Password-Strength-Validator
This project is a Python-based password strength checker. It validates user passwords to ensure they are secure by requiring at least 8 characters, one uppercase letter, one number, and one special character. The program prompts until a strong password is entered, making it useful for learning input validation and security basics
