# Python-based-Password-Strength-Validator
This project is a Python-based Password Strength Validator and Creator.
It ensures that users create strong and secure passwords by enforcing the following rules:

> Minimum length of 8 characters

> At least one uppercase letter

> At least one digit (number)

> At least one special character (e.g., @, #, $, %, !, etc.)

The program will:

> Prompt the user to enter a new password.

> Validate the entered password against the defined rules.

> If the password is weak, it will ask the user to re-enter until a strong password is provided.> 

> Once a strong password is entered, it will confirm that the password has been set successfully.

This project is useful for learning about Python string handling, loops, conditional logic, and user input validation. It can also serve as a foundation for building more advanced authentication systems or security tools.
